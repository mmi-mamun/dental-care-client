***About this project***
### Short brief about this project:
This project is for dental patient. People can visit this website and get information about services. Any one can browse this page, everything is opened for all without Review section.. 

### When user must have to log in:
--Basically everybody should need to login first because of their identity. But we allows to open for all without. We considered them as visitor but We always focused and give more opportunity for registered users--

### Blog Page
-There are 4 powerful and important topics in this page. Every author give answers from their own thinking level. They are legend as I think-

### Use of technologies in this project:
__*Framework: Tailwind*__
Tailwind CSS is a low-level framework. Meaning, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesnâ€™t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.

For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site


_*Component Library: Daisy UI*_
It's a themeable UI components library. It is a plugin for Tailwind CSS. Faster development, Cleaner HTML, Customizable and themeable. Pure CSS. Works on all frameworks. I used many attractive features and component from *Daisy UI*


## Conclusion
_Finally, I can fulfil this project by 3 days working. I think it would be be attractive for all users. This project will be update if needed_
